##AWQUA Testing documentation: Si1132
####**tags: UV light, ambient light**

##1. Component selection
Selected for UV-light sensing. NOTE: This sensor is not a true UV sensor -- given a level of ambient sunlight it calculates a UV index from an internal algorithm. Component is not suitable for, e.g. monitoring UV-254 disinfection; consider the [ML8511](https://github.com/AWQUA/Measurement/tree/master/uv-light/component-ML8511) to meet this need.
##2. Breakout board design
**Design logic:**  
Voltage: 1.71-3.6V  
Bypass capacitor value: 100nF  
Two-wire interface, interrupt pin
